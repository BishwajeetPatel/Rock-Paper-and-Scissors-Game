# Rock-Paper-and-Scissors-Game
Rock Paper Scissors is a simple, hand-gesture-based game typically played between two people. It’s often used as a decision-making tool, like flipping a coin, but with more engagement. The game has three possible hand gestures:

Rock (a fist)
Paper (an open hand)
Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V shape)
Rules:
Each player simultaneously forms one of these three shapes. The outcome of the game is determined by three rules:

Rock beats Scissors: Rock crushes Scissors.
Scissors beats Paper: Scissors cut Paper.
Paper beats Rock: Paper covers Rock.
If both players choose the same gesture, it results in a tie, and the game is usually played again until a winner is determined.

Game Dynamics:
Best of Three: Players may decide to play several rounds, often in a "best of three" format.
Chance and Strategy: While it’s largely a game of chance, some players try to anticipate their opponent's next move based on psychological cues or patterns.
Rock Paper Scissors is often used for fun or as a fair, quick way to resolve a dispute.
